# Snowboard

Snowboard is a Vue.js frontend for [Gecko](https://github.com/ava-labs/gecko) the official Go implementation of an AVA node.

The goal of Snowboard is to provide an easy way to interact with a Gecko node .

Why Snowboard ? Well ... I had no inspiration, so I just picked something related to snow/avalanche/slopes and that ended up
with **board** because it's a kind of dash**board** .

If you want to test, it's [here](https://snowboard-ava.herokuapp.com/)

### Gecko
Since Snowboard is a dashboard for Gecko ... well you'll need a Gecko node in a way or another .

Or you can use [avash](https://docs.ava.network/v1.0/en/tools/avash/)
